Overview of the original code
=============================

Good parts:

- Having parse_row() be a function that simply takes in raw HTML and returns a useful ``dict`` object.


Places for improvement:

- Don't repeat yourself
- Doing too much in one function
- Avoid using regexes when you can parse HTML
