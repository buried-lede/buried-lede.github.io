Everyday Command-Line
=====================

It's possible to be great at data and programming without knowing jack about the shell and the command-line. But such a path is pointlessly dumb and painful. Grokking the Unix philosophy – do one thing and one thing well – and the practice of piping data (i.e. text) between simple utilities, is so useful you may not even need to do "real" programming. And if you do need real programming, the command-line only makes you much much better at learning and using it.


Getting started with Terminal
=============================

- Terminal.app
- Keyboard as destiny
    - Tab to autocomplete
    - up/down for history

- Built-in useful CLI utils
    - curl

- Be good at one thing and one thing only
    - why unix utils seem so basic
    - as a general design and programming philosophy
- common nix utils
    - grep
- pipe operator
    - pipe pipe pipe
    - cat | grep all the things
