Higher-level scripting
**********************

Actual programming – e.g. learning Python or R or Javascript or even SQL – is beyond the scope of this project. However, shell scripting basically is programming. So the aim of this unit is to help you get started on getting into a "proper" language, and to give you a taste of *why* you'd want to do it – which can be hard to convey if you've seen the amazing usefulness of shell scripting.


- R and RStudio
    - RStudio seems much easier and straightforward to install for the average user, compared to Python (even with conda)
    - RStudio basics
        - why R syntax is NOT the same as shell syntax
        - variables and variable assignment
        - quoting strings
        - functions
    - How to do cool stuff with ggplot2
        - use built in datasets like iris
        - switching between chart types
        - tweaking colors
        - making PNGs
    - Data wrangling basics
        - dataframes
        - opening files (CSV, XLS)
        - saving files as CSV

- Web scraping with R
    - enough HTML concepts to understand why regex is not enough
    - CSS selector
    - xpath for funsies
    - how HTML turns into data
        - copy-pasting HTML tables into a spreadsheet
        - scraping non-tabular HTML into CSV
    - [todo] mirror a website to practice on

- R outside of RStudio
    - just use VSCode
    - running R scripts from the commandline
    - reproducible data->viz R script
    - rmarkdown?

- SQLite
    - Using a GUI like DB Browser
        - Why SQL and not Excel?
    - Basic SQL syntax
        - SELECT queries and how they compare to spreadsheets
    - SQLite without a GUI
        - invoking sqlite3 from the command line
        - dot commands/config
        - turning sqlite into a CSV
    - optional (combining sqlite scripts with R scripts to make viz)
