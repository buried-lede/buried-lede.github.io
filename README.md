# The Buried Lede of Data Journalism and Learning to Code

Inspired by MIT's ["Missing Semester of Your CS Education"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) (related HN thread / tweet thread), but tailored to folks who aren't learning computer science as a career or degree program â€“ in other words, people who want to learn programming to be better at whatever their current job or passion.




## Syllabus (brainstorm in progress)
